# What is Integral theorem ?

Intergral TheoremÂ genralizesÂ Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem. This theorem is also called theÂ ExtendedÂ orÂ Second Mean Value Theorem. It establishes the relationship between the derivatives of two functions and changes in these functions on a finite interval.

Let the functionsÂ f(x) andÂ g(x) be continuous on an intervalÂ [a,b], differentiable onÂ (a,b),andÂ gâ€²(x)â‰ 0 for allÂ xâˆˆ(a,b). Then there is a pointÂ x=c in this interval such that

f(b)âˆ’f(a) / g(b)âˆ’g(a) = fâ€²(c) / gâ€²(c).
