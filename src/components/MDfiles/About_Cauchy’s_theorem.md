# What is Cauchy’s mean value theorem ?

Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem genralizes Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem. This theorem is also called the Extended 
or Second Mean Value Theorem. It establishes the relationship between the derivatives of two functions and changes 4
in these functions on a finite interval.

Let the functions f(x) and g(x) be continuous on an interval [a,b], differentiable on (a,b),and 
g′(x)≠0 for all x∈(a,b). Then there is a point x=c in this interval such that

f(b)−f(a) / g(b)−g(a) = f′(c) / g′(c).
